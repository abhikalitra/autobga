        <h1>AutoBGA Help</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Generating footprints with AutoBGA is easy. All you need
		is to do is extract an image of the ball pattern from the datasheet's
		package drawing. AutoBGA will then generate the ball coordinates
		using image processing and output a list of the balls present
		in the grid.</p>

		<p>This short help file will guide you through the process. Furthermore,
		the default settings when you start AutoBGA are for an example using
		a picture that comes with the program. You can simply press the
		<b>"Compute"</b> button to see it in action.</p>

		<h2>How to use AutoBGA</h2>
		<p>Using AutoBGA is a straight-forward process. <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows the section
		of a datasheet with a BGA package drawing.</p>
		
		<a name="figure1"></a>
		<table border="2">
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center"><b>Figure 1: Three steps to configuring AutoBGA</b></div></td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	        <td><img src="sample_pdf_steps.png"></td>
	        </tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3>Configuring AutoBGA</h3>
		<p>Two views are usually presented:
		<ol>
			<li>A view of the package from the top, indicating location of pin A1.</li>
			<li>A view of the package form the bottom, showing the emplacement of connection balls.</li>
		</ol></p>
		
		<p>From these two views, all the information required to configure an AutoBGA session
		is available.</p>
		
		<p>The are 3 configuration steps to execute:
		<ol>
			<li>Locate the the <b>package dimensions</b> (width, height) and the <b>number
			of balls</b> (width, height). In the example, the package width and height
			are available in a table on the same page(not shown), and the number of ball
			is 44 horizontally (width) and vertically (height).</li>
			<li>Enter the <b>location of pin A1</b> from the top view. Here, it would be
			"NW" for "North West".</li>
			<li>Extract the <b>region displaying the balls</b>. Most times it will be
			shown on the bottom view, but sometimes they will appear through
			transparency on the top view instead. The next section discusses image
			extraction in more details.</li>
		</ol></p>
		
		<h3>Extracting the ball grid image for processing</h3>
		<p>To extract the region displaying the balls, you can use the "snapshot" or
		"picture" tool available in most PDF viewers. Figures <a href="#figure2">2</a> and <a href="#figure3">3</a> show what these
		tools look like in two popular PDF readers. These tools copy the image to the
		clipboard. You can then paste the image in any image processing program such
		as "Paint" or "IrfanView" to save it. It must be saved as a "PNG" or "BMP"
		image, in either grayscale or RGB (24 or 32 bits).</p>
		
		<p>Important characteristics of the image:
		<ul>
			<li>The image must not have white space around it. It must contain
			only the ball grid. See the red square region in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> for an
			example of correct cropping.</li>
			<li>The resolution of the image must be sufficient. You must be able
			to easily make-out each ball. This is usually not a problem.</li>
			<li>The image must not have colors. It must be "black-and-white"
			to your perception. Background must be white and details must be
			black. This is the case of the vast majority of datasheets. It is
			okay if there are things like alignment lines or squares. 
			These will be ignored.</li>
		</ul>  </p>
		 
		<p><a name="figure2"></a><table border="2" cellpadding="2">
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center"><b>Figure 2: Snapshot Tool in Adobe Reader</b></div></td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center"><img src="adobe_reader_snapshot_tool.png"></div></td>
	        </tr>
		</table></p>
		
		<p><a name="figure3"></a><table border="2" cellpadding="2">
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center"><b>Figure 3: Snapshot Tool in Foxit PDF Reader</b></div></td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center"><img src="foxit_picture_tool.png"></div></td>
	        </tr>
		</table></p>

		<p>Once the image is saved as PNG or BMP, the filename can be entered in the
		<b>"Input Image Filename"</b> field. A preview will be shown after the grid is
		computed using the <b>"Compute"</b> button.</p>
		
	    <h3>Interpreting the result report</h3>
		<p>After the ball grid is computed, a result report will be shown and the data
		will be copied to the clipboard. The report contains the following 3 sections:
		<ol>
			<li><b>Input image preview</b>: A preview of what AutoBGA loaded.</li>
			
			<li><b>Pads detected overlay</b>: An image showing a red dot in every cell where
			a ball was detected in the input image. A grid of blue lines is also present
			to show which cells were used to detect the balls.</li>
			
			<li><b>Table representation of output footprint</b>: A table that shows the final
			ball grid that was output. This takes in account mirroring ("Picture view")
			and pin A1 location. Cells with balls have a cyan background. Empty cells
			have a white background. Pin A1 is marked by a red background.</li>
		</ol></p>
		
		<h2>Output formats</h2>
		Three output formats are currently supported. Two of these formats (TSV and XML)
		are flexible enough to allow re-processing to generate CAD data for the majority
		of CAD tools.
		
		<h3>TSV Format</h3>
		<p>The TSV format lists all pads detected (occupied cells). The heading in the
		file specifies the column contents. Pads are not output in any specific order.
		Sorting can be accomplished using a spreadsheet program.
		</p>
		
		<p><a name="table1"></a><table border="2" cellpadding="2">
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center"><b>Table 1: Example of TSV output format</b></div></td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	        <td><div align="center">
				<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
				    <tr><td>Pad name</td><td>X position (mm)</td><td>Y position (mm)</td><td>Pad diameter (mm)</td></tr>
				    <tr><td>AE25</td><td>-7.800</td><td>7.800</td><td>0.300</td></tr>
				    <tr><td>AE24</td><td>-7.150</td><td>7.800</td><td>0.300</td></tr>
				    <tr><td>AE23</td><td>-6.500</td><td>7.800</td><td>0.300</td></tr>
				    <tr><td>AE22</td><td>-5.850</td><td>7.800</td><td>0.300</td></tr>
				</table>
	        </div></td>
	        </tr>
		</table></p>

		<a name="xml-format"></a>
		<h3>XML Format</h3>

		<p>The XML format lists all pads detected (occupied cells) using
		an XML representation from the JFootprintTool program. The XML
		schema is available in the home directory of the program.
		</p>
		
		<a name="eagle-format"></a>
		<h3>EAGLE SCR Format</h3>
		<p>The EAGLE SCR format contains EAGLE commands to draw all the pads
		detected in the EAGLE library editor. Simply create a new "package" in
		the library editor and then run the script with the "SCR" EAGLE command. 
		The script must be pasted in a text editor and saved before being used.
