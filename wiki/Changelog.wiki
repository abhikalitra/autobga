= Change log for AutoBGA =

== v1.1, released January 16, 2011 ==
  * IMPROVEMENT: Better cross and line removal in images.
  * FEATURE: Added a second thresholding algorithm better-suited for cases with high-resolution and fine lines. This has fixed numerous cases of improper ball detection that were present in version 1.0.
  * IMPROVEMENT: Smaller UI footprint owing to displacement of parameters from top of window to a separate tab.
  * IMPROVEMENT: Automatically switches to results tab after computing.

== v1.0, released September 13, 2010 ==
  * Initial release.
  * Works as advertised, but still some sub-optimal cases where cleaning-up of images is required.
